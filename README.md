# CHOC-ICU-Prediction
Statistical Model which attempts to predict if a patient will need to be transferred to the ICU in the next hour.

These files only represent the data pipeline, the data itself is not included because it is sensitive medical data. We are likewise unable to share the output of these notebooks because they display sensitive medical information at some points. 

The respective files included show the code used in obtaining statistics about the patients' chronic conditions, basic statistics about the entire Cerner Real World Dataset, a histogram of the age of the relevant patient subset (patients under the age of 18 with an encounter duration of greater than 24 hours), and the file that produces the model.
